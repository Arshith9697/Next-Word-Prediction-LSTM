An end-to-end next-word prediction system built using TensorFlow and LSTM-based RNNs. The project covers text preprocessing, tokenization, n-gram sequence generation, padding, and categorical label creation, followed by training a deep LSTM language model on Shakespeare’s Hamlet.

The repository also includes tokenizer persistence using Pickle to ensure consistent word-index mapping between training and inference, along with a Streamlit web application that loads the trained model and tokenizer to provide real-time next-word predictions through an interactive user interface.
